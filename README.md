# codebindle
A Chrome Extension for grabbing code snippets from a web page using the keyboard. 

You're working on some code, flying with the keyboard. You need to google how to defluke the grimpstoppers, so you launch a browser (still using the keyboard), run the search, tab to the first search result.
Hooray - a code sample! Now you have to take your hand off the keyboard and use the mouse to highlight that golden nugget of code for the copying. Booo.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could just hit some buttons on the keyboard to select the code on the webpage? 

This is what this extension does.
